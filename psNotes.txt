	syntax: git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone>

		- can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the directory (git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone> new-directory-name)
		- will create a new repository inside the current working directory

git status COMMAND:
	Command used to display the current status of the repository.
	It will:
		- display new files that have been created in the working directory that Git hasn't started tracking yet
